# Anki Decks for Genki Study Resources
This folder contains Anki decks for Genki 2nd and 3rd Edition. You can find the 2nd Edition decks in the [lessons](lessons/) folder and the 3rd Edition decks in the [lessons-3rd](lessons-3rd/) folder.


### How to Download the Decks

To download a single deck, you can go to an edition's folder, click the deck, and then download it via the download button. 

To download all decks at once, you can [download this repo](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/genki-study-resources/archive/master.zip), unzip the contents, then navigate to **resources/tools/decks** and open the folder for the 2nd (lessons) or 3rd (lessons-3rd) Edition to access their decks.


### How to Import the Decks
Once you have your decks, open Anki and click "Import File" (either with the bottom button or via File > Import...) to import your decks. 

That's it, you're done. Now you're ready to study the vocab!
